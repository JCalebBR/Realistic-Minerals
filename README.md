# Realistic Minerals

This mod adds 16 new minerals to the game, alongside new Obonto trades for each. 
This mod is based on an "educated guess" after a quick study (more like 8 hours) of Cassini's data on Saturn's rings, and the composition of the asteroid belts.

While some of the information was a bit vague, I tried to make the best of it by comparing the data to the minerals we have on Earth, and the prices of the minerals in the game.

Prices are based on how useful the minerals would be to a theoretical space faring civilization, how difficult it would be to extract them, how difficult it would be to process them, and how rare they are. There's definitely a lot of guess work involved, some decisions were arbitrary, but overall I tried to make it as realistic as possible.

Definitely was aided by ChatGPT to process the data and help me make decisions.

To run the game with mods, run it with the `--enable-mods` command-line parameter. If using Steam, you can add the parameter in the game's properties → General → Launch Options.
